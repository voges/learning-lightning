# MLOps Playground

This is an [MLOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLOps) playground revolving around an autoencoder trained on the [MNIST](https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset.

Currently, the following tools are used:

- [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) (application configuration)
- [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) (MLOps platform)
- [Optuna](https://optuna.org/) (hyperparameter optimization)
- [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/) (deep learning framework)
